This program uses mqtt to control a lamp remotely from an app on the phone. All you need to do is download the app, set up the dashboard, subscribe to the broker on the Linux terminal, and run the code, and the lamp should be able to be turned on and off from the switch on the app.

This was made with help from Zac Winters, Peter Nguyen, and Milan
